- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Krzysztof Jablonski.
- ğŸ‘€ When I'm not cycling or doing something else, I'm interested in various aspects of programming. My main focus is C#, but I'm open to other languages/platforms.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently exploring usage of functional patterns in a non functional language like C#. And learning Python and F#.
